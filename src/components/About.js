                        I do my best to stay active in my free time. Weightlifting is my favorite type of exercise. Cardio
                        isn't my favorite but I do enjoy cycling outdoors and indoors - I have a Peloton. I sometimes trick
                        myself into running by playing basketball but I would prefer to go on a long hike.</p>

                    <p className="activity-card-p">I have been to many different places around the world but have yet to visit Europe. I'm hoping to
                        cross that off my bucket list soon! My favorite vacation so far has been my recent trip to Tulum,
                        Mexico.</p>

                    <p className="activity-card-p">I listen to all different kinds of music but my favorites at the moment have to be hip hop and house music.
                        Hip hop gets me pumped up and I love house music because I enjoy dancing.</p>

                    <p className="activity-card-p">Golfing is a new hobby of mine. I am not a great golfer but I'm excited to say I purchased my first
                        set of clubs! I look forward to improving my game and having fun along the way. Tips and tricks are greatly appreciated!</p>

                        city with so much to offer. My favorite kinds of food are Italian and Mexican but I will try almost anything. Please send food recommendations!</p>

                    <p className="activity-card-p">I don't watch much TV but when I do it's usually YouTube videos - I have learned so much from YouTube! My favorite
                        movie genres are action, comedy, and horror. Fun fact, I haven't been to the movies since 2015. I am a huge fan of the show Breaking Bad and currently
                        hooked on Better Call Saul.</p>

                    <p className="activity-card-p">I enjoy DIY projects because it's fun to build things with your hands the way you want them to be built! I have renovated
                        a kitchen, several bathrooms and even built my own kitchen banquette with storage. DIY projects are a good opportunity to get in touch with my creative
                        side, spend time with my dad and friends and challenge myself by doing something new.</p>
